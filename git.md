## What is Git?
Git is a distributed version-control system for tracking changes in source code during software development. It is designed for coordinating work among programmers, but it can be used to track changes in any set of files. Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows.
## Important terms

#### Repository:

It is the collection of files and folders (code files) that you’re using git to track.

#### Commit:

The "commit" command is used to save your changes to the local repository.

#### Push:

Pushing is essentially syncing your commits to GitLab.

#### Branch:

A branch is like a parallel world where you can create commit without introducing bugs into production code.

#### Merge:

Merge integrates two branches. When a branch becomes error free and is ready to become part of main branch, it is merged.

#### Clone:

Clone means making an exact copy on local machine.

#### Fork:

A fork is a copy of a repository that allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.

On Windows, it’s just as simple. You [download the installer](https://git-scm.com/download/win) and run it.

## Git Workflow
This helps to use Git to accomplish work in a consistent and productive manner. Git workflows encourage users to leverage Git effectively and consistently. Git offers a lot of flexibility in how users manage changes.
