# Assignment - Github Profile

Now that you have understanding of Git and Markdown, it's time for your profile building using these two.

Github has introduced a ✨special ✨ repository that you can use to add a README.md to your GitHub profile. It is like a small portfolio to present yourself on your github profile. So you will try to build your Github profile more Awesome.

Steps for the same:

1. Go to your Github profile and create a repository.
2. Name of the repository should be your username, as you will type your username, you'll get an instant message:

   ```You found a secret! {username}/{username} is a ✨special ✨ repository that you can use to add a README.md to your GitHub profile. Make sure it’s public and initialize it with a README to get started.```
3. So as said initialize the repository with a Readme and make it public.    

4. Now you will see, Github has already gave a template for this readme.md in repository, and you can try to edit it, and try to add more features to it like providing links of your social media accounts.

5. After editing save it, and go to your main profile, you will see that readme with your profile like this one [here.](https://github.com/arpit-dwivedi)
